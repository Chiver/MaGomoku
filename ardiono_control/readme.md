# Ardiono Control Readme 

We use flask server to control two arduino boards. 

## Initialization
1. `python3 -m venv venv` 
2. `source ./venv/bin/activate` 
3. `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` 

## Run server 
To run server, call `python3 server.py`. Make sure that you have the arduino board connected.
